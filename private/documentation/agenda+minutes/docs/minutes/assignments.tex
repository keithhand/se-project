Team roles have been assigned as well as main programming language (PHP).
We will utilize Github for clean documentation as well as ease of access for the entire group
to work independently outside of one another for the main project. Keith will host
a server for our needs and all participants will go over the basic premise of PHP alongside
downloading PhpStorm and Docker for later usage.
